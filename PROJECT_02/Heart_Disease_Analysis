# **Heart Disease Analysis: Understanding Key Risk Indicators**

## **Problem Statement:**
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Identifying risk factors
and understanding their impact can help develop strategies for early detection and
prevention. This project aims to analyze a dataset of heart disease patients to explore
patterns and correlations among key health indicators, such as cholesterol levels, blood
pressure, and age, to determine their relationship with heart disease.
